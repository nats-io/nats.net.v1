# This repository will be renamed to `nats.net.v1` on Wednesday, July 17th, 2024

We wanted to let you know about an upcoming rename to our NATS .NET GitHub repositories on Wednesday, July 17. Here's what's changing:

* V1 Current: `nats-io/nats.net` New: `nats-io/nats.net.v1`
* V2 Current: `nats-io/nats.net.v2` New: `nats-io/nats.net`

We're renaming them to enhance clarity and to help build a consistent NATS .NET brand.
This change is important to us because it helps prevent confusion for our developers and users,
especially new folks joining us. Plus, it supports our goal of growing the NATS .NET community.

We recommend using NATS .NET v2, but please rest assured that we will continue to support and maintain v1 as usual.

We'll be making these updates around 1 PM ET (GMT-5) on that day. The good news is that we don’t expect any
disruptions, as package delivery is handled through NuGet.

If you have bookmarks to the current repositories or their documentation (GitHub pages), please be prepared
to update them. GitHub will automatically redirect `nats-io/nats.net.v2` to `nats-io/nats.net`, but unfortunately,
it won't do the same for the v1 repository. Also, if you’ve forked these repositories, you'll need to update
your upstream remotes for Git.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!
